I'm Ariel Lellouch, a research geoscientist. I am passionate about seismic wave propagation, and more importantly - what can we infer from these waves regarding subsurface properties. Currently, I'm working on cool applications of DAS data to all sorts of geophysical problems!

I am always on the look for new, interesting questions! I'd be happy to hear from you about (almost) anything at <a href="mailto:lellouch@gmail.com">my gmail (lellouch@gmail.com)</a> or <a href="ariellel@stanford.edu">at Stanford  (ariellel@stanford.edu)</a> , so feel free!
