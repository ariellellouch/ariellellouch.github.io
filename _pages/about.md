I'm Ariel Lellouch, a research geoscientist. I am passionated about seismic wave propagation, and more importantly - what can we infer from the subsurface properties when recording these waves. I've studied passive seismic velocity estimation, location problems, Q-factor inversion, time-reversal, diffraction imaging, PS imaging and velocity analysis, SH waves and more...

I am always on the look for new, interesting problems! I'd be happy to hear from you about (almost) anything at <a href="mailto:lellouch@email.com">my gmail</a>, so feel free!
