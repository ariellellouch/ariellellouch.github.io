I'm Ariel Lellouch, a research geoscientist. I am passionated about seismic wave propagation, and more importantly - what can we infer from the subsurface properties when recording these waves. I've studied passive seismic velocity estimation, location problems, Q-factor inversion, time-reversal, diffraction imaging, PS imaging and velocity analysis, SH waves and more, and am always on the look for new, interesting problems!

I'd be happy to hear from you about (almost) anything at <address>lellouch@gmail.com</address>, so feel free!
