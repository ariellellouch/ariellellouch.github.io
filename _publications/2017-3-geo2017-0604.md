permalink: /publication/2017-3-geo2017-0604
excerpt: 'In this study, we utilize a physical objective function for Q-factor inversion. Assuming correct velocity and attenuation models, back-propagation of recorded data should have the same spectral content at the source location. This property is used in a global optimization scheme, allowing for high-resolution Q-model recovery.'
