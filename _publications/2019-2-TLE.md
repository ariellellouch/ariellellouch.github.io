title: "DAS observations and modeling of perforation-induced guided waves in a shale reservoir"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-2-TLE.md
excerpt: 'Perforation shots conducted in unconventional reservoirs excite guided waves that propagate through the low-velocity shale formation. These waves are recorded by a downhole DAS array and have a wide frequency content. In a cross-well acquisition, guided S-waves are disturbed when propagating through previously stimulated areas.'
