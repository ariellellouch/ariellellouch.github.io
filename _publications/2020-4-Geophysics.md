title: "Fracture properties estimation using distributed acoustic sensing recording of guided waves in unconventional reservoirs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-4-Geophysics.md
excerpt: 'DAS can record high-frequency guided waves excited by perforation shots and propagating in a low velocity shale reservoir. Using a cross-well setup, we can infer stimulation-induced horizontal fracture growth by its effect on guided waves.'
