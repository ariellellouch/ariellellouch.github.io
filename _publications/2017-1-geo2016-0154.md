excerpt: 'We show the advantages of using a pure SH-waves cross-hole acquisition for diffraction imaging. After implementing an automatic model-based direct-waves muting, we migrate diffracted events to a depth imaging offset domain. In it, gathers will be flat only if estimated diffractor location and velocity model are correct.'
