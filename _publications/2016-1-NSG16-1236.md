title: "Usage of directional common image gathers for shallow seismic source localization"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/NSG16-1236
excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore using multi-parameter common image gathers (MPCIGs) as a tool for event location. When both estimated event location and used velocity model are correct, the MPCIGs will have no residual moveout. We explore the usage of such gathers for a one-way migration, with unknown source location and origin time.'
