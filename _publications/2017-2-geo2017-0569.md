permalink: /publication/2017-2-geo2017-0569
excerpt: 'In this paper, we utilize the time-reversal principle for seismic velocity estimation. Recorded data are back-propagated through various velocity models. When the model is correct, energy will be focused at the true source location and origin time. By illustrating the method on a direct source-receiver path example (cross-hole acquisition), smooth velocity models may be used for back-propagation.'
